My Linux system (Ubuntu 12.10) was suddenly having problems with IPv6, and dmesg said:

IPv6: wlan0: IPv6 duplicate address 2a00:cd8:blabla:1af4:6aff:fe9c:ced4 detected!
IPv6: ipv6_create_tempaddr: regeneration time exceeded - disabled temporary address support 

The workaround was to disable Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for the IPv6 privacy extensions on my Wifi interface wlan0:

sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_dad=0

Please note: if you use wired ethernet eth0, you should do something like this:

sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_dad=0

It is unclear to me where the problem is: in Linux itself , or in my modem, or in the interaction between Linux and my modem.
The problem also occurs in OpenSuSE 12.2 on the same LAN, so it's not a Ubuntu-only problem.

Bug report is here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1120617

Update: it seems to be related to Wifi; it does not happen with wired ethernet.

sysctl net.ipv6.conf.ens160.accept_dad=0

Two gateway machines, use keepalive.

The IPv6 address display:

inet6 x:x:x:x::1/64 scope global tentative dadfailed
and can't ping6 this address.

The reason is when another master machine is down, but the ipv6 address is not delete, and the new master machine can't use this address.

To prevent this:

$ sysctl -a | grep accept_dad
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_dad = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_dad = 0
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_dad = 0
net.ipv6.conf.eth1.accept_dad = 0
net.ipv6.conf.lo.accept_dad = -1
net.ipv6.conf.tun0.accept_dad = -1
net.ipv6.conf.tun1.accept_dad = -1

# Than change the physic netcard's value to 0
$ sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_dad=0
$ sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth1.accept_dad=0

# Than delete the keepalive vip and create it
The meaning of accept_dad:

accept_dad - INTEGER
    Whether to accept DAD (Duplicate Address Detection).
        0: Disable DAD
        1: Enable DAD (default)
        2: Enable DAD, and disable IPv6 operation if MAC-based duplicate
            link-local address has been found.
